## I can: develop an application on React, make queries using Axios + React Query, implement Redux Toolkit into the project, adapt the site to mobile devices, deploy the application, use SCSS and Tailwind. 

## At the moment I am looking for a job/internship in a company with a modern stack: React (Next.js) + Redux-toolkit + TypeScript. I am fond of photography and snowboarding.
